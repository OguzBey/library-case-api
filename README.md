### 1- Only docker Method (for production)

Set the environments. And start the project

```bash
docker compose up --build -d
```

- Note: you must be in same path with docker-compose.yml file.
- Note 2: DB_FULL_HOST cannot be localhost use docker-compose service name. db_postgres:5432

### 2- Semi docker method (good for development)

First set the environments. And db up with docker compose

```bash
docker compose up -d db_postgres
```

Now db up and connectable. DB opened the port 5432 to localhost.

```bash
npm run dev # for run development with nodemon
```

```bash
npm run build && npm run start # for run with production build
```
